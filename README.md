# Unit 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
This assignment was to create limited HTML and CSS and have it powered by our JavaScript files to create a game. The game theme was "Code Quiz". Without starter code, our job was to make a functioning quiz-like game that asked questions, allowed for answers to be selected, kept track of answers, and showed a score. The final product needed to end when time ran out or all the questions were answered and then prompt users for initials to track their score. HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript were used and implemented for this project.


### Project Details
Using the above mentioned technologies and absolutley no code sources to start with, the deployed application was created. The application consists of the following:

- A very lightly created and styled HTML shell.
- Little to no CSS in the StyleSheet.
- A boat load of JavaScript to control the page functionality, displays, and game contents.
- Explanation to the user for how the game is to be played.
- Color alerts of Red or Green when the users gets a questions wrong or right.
- Time is deducted when a user gets a question wrong.
- A current score for the user.
- Question counter that tracks the number of questions answered and the max questions possible.
- A prompt asking the user for their initials.
- Highscores are stored on a scoring page.
 
 #### Results
 The final application performs as expected and meets the requirements given above. This was a very challenging project and took significantly more time than anticipated, mostly because of the extensive JavaScript involved in page setup and functionality. It was really fun and I learned so much about JavaScript along the way. I just wish I had more time!
